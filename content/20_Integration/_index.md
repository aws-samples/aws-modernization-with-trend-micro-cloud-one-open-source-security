## Getting Started

There are many ways to get started and to test your application or tap into your own code repo. For this workshop, we will provide a sample application on [GitHub](https://github.com/snyk/java-goof) and outline a couple options to get started with this sample application:


**GitHub Integration**

- **Option 1** will allow those that have a GitHub account, or wish to create a GitHub account, or wish to point to their own repo, to use this option.

- **Option 2** will give those that do not have a GitHub account or knowledge of code repos an easy process to follow to get started with this lab.

**Snyk Command Line Interface (CLI)**

- **Snyk CLI** will give those that do not have a GitHub account or knowledge of code repos an easy process to follow to get started with this lab.

Take note that the sample application is sized to be up and running quickly. 

Let's get started :computer: :rocket:
